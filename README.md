# Checklist Wrangler Syntax File

Very simple syntax file for plaintext checklists, also usable by the iOS app [Checklist Wrangler](http://buckaroosoftware.com/ChecklistWrangler.html).

## Installation

If you use [Pathogen](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2332)(and you should), do this:

    $ cd ~/.vim/bundle
    $ git clone https://github.com/dogrover/vim-syntax-checklist-wrangler.git

To install without Pathogen, download the [tarball](https://github.com/dogrover/vim-syntax-checklist-wrangler/archive/master.tar.gz) and do this:

    $ cd ~/.vim
    $ tar --strip=1 -zxf vim-syntax-checklist-wrangler-master.tar.gz
